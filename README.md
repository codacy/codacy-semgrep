# Codacy Semgrep

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [Semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) support.

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

  ```bash
  docker build -t codacy-semgrep:latest .
  ```

The docker is ran with the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src codacy-semgrep:latest
  ```

## Generate Docs

 1. Update the version in `go.mod`
 2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

 3. Run the DocGenerator:

```bash
go run ./doc-generator.go &&\
scala-cli doc-generator.sc
```

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.
